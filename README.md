This repo is the official Strife distribution.

Since all projects have their own repository in [this GitHub organization](https://github.com/the-strife-project), there has to be a way to glue them all together.

This distribution is stable: it will never intentionally contain unfinished parts that break everything. It also has a simple Makefile which compiles all the programs in [the `projects` directory](https://github.com/the-strife-project/Strife/tree/master/projects) and creates an ISO file.

This distro has _everything_ that I've written.

The build process is automated on each push. You can get the latest ISO, as well as the compressed version (for flexing on the size), [here](https://github.com/the-strife-project/Strife/releases/latest).
